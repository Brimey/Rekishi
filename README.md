# Rekishi
Rekishi is a tool used to collect chat data from a Twitch stream and gives you the option of just having the parsed data (text file) saved locally or emailing it to a recipient(s). The type of data collected:
- The keyword you're searching for.
- Which user(s) said the keyword (along with the message the keyword was in).
- The date and time the message was sent.
